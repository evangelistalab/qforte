     * second quantized operators.
     * The significance of the linear combination is context-dependent, but it should refer
     * to a "basis combination" in some sense, i.e., antihermitian combination for UCC,
     * spin-adapted combination for closed-shell systems, a single operator for traditional CC.
     *
     * All storage, printing, and input of summands in the combination takes tuples of the following form:
     * (1) coefficient
     * (2) vector of orbital-indices of creation operators
     * (3) vector of orbital-indices of annihilation operators,
     * All orbital indices start at zero.
     * Index vectors are lexicographic, i.e., std::tuple<1, {p, q}, {s, r}> means 1 * p^ q^ s r.
