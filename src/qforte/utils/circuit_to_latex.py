    This function constructs the filename.tex latex
    file with the graphical representation of the given
    quantum circuit.

    Depending on how large the circuit is,
    compiling with lualatex is advisable.

    The quantikz package is required for
    compiling the tex file.

    Arguments
    =========

    circ: Circuit object
        The quantum circuit that we want to plot.

    filename: string
        The name of the latex file. The ".tex"
        file extension is not necessary.

    max_circuit_depth_per_tikz: int
        The maximum circuit dpeth for a given tikz
        drawing. To improve compilation efficiency,
        instead of generating a single, potentially
        large, tikz drawing, the circuit is split into
        multiple tikz figures, each containing at most
        max_circuit_depth_per_tikz layers.
        WARNING: Setting this parameter to a large
        number can significantly increase the latex
        compilation time.

    Returns
    =======

    filename.tex: latex file
        The latex file containing the plot of the
        given quantum circuit.
